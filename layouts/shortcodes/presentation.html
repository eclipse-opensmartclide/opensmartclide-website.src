		<p><strong>Eclipse OpenSmartCLIDE</strong> enables organizations on the path to digitalization to accelerate the creation and adoption of Cloud solutions. The innovative smart cloud-native development environment will support creators of cloud services in the discovery, creation, composition, testing, and deployment of full-stack data-centered services and applications in the cloud.</p>
		<p>Eclipse OpenSmartCLIDE is based on <a href="https://theia-ide.org/">Eclipse Theia</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Its main features are:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Life cycle support</strong>. Software follows a life cycle, from feature specification to solution deployment. Eclipse OpenSmartCLIDE provides the specific tools required at each life-cycle stage. For example, at the development stage, Eclipse OpenSmartCLIDE provides data sources, data transformations, graphics visualization artifacts, and general-purpose abstractions and patterns that can be combined to implement features.</li>
			<li><strong>Insightful source code monitoring</strong>. Eclipse OpenSmartCLIDE includes visualization features that help developers gain deeper understanding of the source code. It dynamically shows the meaning of expressions or code flow at low levels of granularity. It also allows developers to compare different software states, perform state changes that are reflected dynamically, and create new abstractions that can be easily reused.</li>
			<li><strong>CI/CD integration</strong>. Eclipse OpenSmartCLIDE enables integration with widely used CI/CD tools such as GitHub and GitLab.</li>
		</ul>
