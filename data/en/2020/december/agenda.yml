             <p>The main objective of <a href="http://smartclide.eu" target="_blank">SmartCLIDE</a> is to propose a new smart cloud-native
             development environment, based on the coding-by-demonstration principle, that 
             will support creators of cloud services in the discovery, creation, composition, 
             testing, and deployment of full-stack data-centered services and applications in the cloud. <br/>
             Cloud distributed systems are highly complex due to the wide variety of technologies and 
             frameworks that can be used in the whole stack, the underlying microservice architectures, 
             or the management of the deployment pipeline. To develop services from scratch is expensive, 
             as well as time-consuming, and one of the main challenges IT companies are facing is reflected 
             in the difficulty to find qualified IT staff in the market to face these challenges. <br/>
             SmartCLIDE will be based on <strong>Eclipse THEIA</strong>, the cloud version of the Eclipse IDE, offering all 
             the necessary tools for developing in one single place. It will be a rich interface, with a vast 
             range of features to accelerate the deployment of cloud services, improve their quality, and 
             expand the skills of novel and experienced developers.<br/>
             SmartCLIDE will to boost the adoption of Cloud solutions, being validated at one solution-oriented 
             to Public Administration and three different IoT and Big Data products of software development 
             SMEs within the consortium.</p>

             <p><a href="https://www.reachout-project.eu/" target="_blank">ReachOut</a> is an H2020 Coordination and Support Action (CSA), aiming at 
             helping research projects or European SMEs to develop connections with their 
             markets and potential end users. ReachOut provides a BetaCenter platform and 
             methodology to help projects create and implement their beta-testing campaigns, 
             collect user feedback and develop their ecosystem. This presentation will give 
             you an overview of the ReachOut project, and present the BetaCenter.</p>
