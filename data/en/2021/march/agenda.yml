           <p>This talk will present the main results of the <a href= "https://www.decoder-project.eu">DECODER H2020 project</a>.
           The main goal of the project is to offer a unified platform (the PKM, Persistent Knowledge Monitor)
           for hosting all kinds of documents related to a given software project,
           including source code, manuals, bug reports. A variety of tools are
           interacting with the PKM to fill it with additional information and/or
           take advantage of information provided by other tools. This includes
           notably the results of static analyses, program proofs, and test case
           generation on the one hand, and the extraction of more formal
           specifications from natural language documents using natural language
           processing techniques. Two years after its start, DECODER is finalizing
           the first prototypes of its main tools and aims at polishing its API for
           easier integration with external tools such as IDEs.</p>

           <p>The <a href="https://www.pdp4e-project.eu/">PDP4E H2020 project</a> has focused on is defining methods and software tools for
           privacy engineering based on models, including risk management, privacy requirements 
           engineering, privacy aware design and privacy assurance. This webinar will show how one 
           can engineer a complete set of privacy protection models taking into account existing privacy 
           frameworks. It will describe two examples, connected vehicles and smart grid data exchange. 
           It will then present an initiative to create an privacy engineering open model community.</p>
