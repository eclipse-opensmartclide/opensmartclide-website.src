           <p>ProActive Machine Learning (PML) from Activeeon, is an open-source platform for the distribution 
           and parallelization of machine learning (ML) workloads on any large infrastructure. It enables researchers, 
           data scientists, developers and IT administrators to work together to design and automate ML pipelines from 
           development to production. It manages distributed AutoML experiments, dispatches and runs parallel jobs 
           generated by tuning algorithms to search the optimal neural architecture and/or hyperparameters. 
           Once in production, PML allows real-time monitoring of the performance of deployed models and alerts 
           users when an important issue is detected. </p>

          <p>Traceability needs to be tailored to the organisation and the engineers that use it.
          For this purpose, it needs to integrate into existing processes, interface with existing tools, 
          and provide a suitable structure. Eclipse Capra is an open-source traceability management tool 
          that provides the extensibility and flexibility required to fit into a specific environment.
          In this talk, I will present how Eclipse Capra can be used to perform common traceability activities such 
          as change impact analysis and coverage analysis. I will also show how it can be extended to interface with 
          the tools currently used in the development process and how it can provide structure for the traceability 
          links by providing a custom traceability information model.
          The presentation will be a great introduction to anyone looking for a traceability solution that can be 
          integrated into their existing Eclipse-based tool-chain as well as for engineers looking for a traceability 
          management tools that fits their specific requirements. Eclipse Capra is being further developed in the 
          scope of the ITEA3 Project Panorama - Accelerating design efficiency for automotive and aerospace systems.</p>
